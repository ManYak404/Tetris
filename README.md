I learned more about how to organize scripts in relation to GameObjects and Prefabs. I believe I did it wrong in this implementation because I stored alot of data and alot of
functionality inside of single scripts.

The assignment took me quite a few hours to complete and the longest thing to implement was the rotating of tetris blocks due to the rotation algorithm, and deletion of cleared 
lines because of poor debugging and documentation of older code.
